/* So I'll need to run the one of two commands in the terminal to complete any updates on my SCSS files
as they will need to be compiled and rendered to our .CSS file in our public folder.

We can use:

'npm run dev' (which will complile and render on each time this runs)

or

'npm run watch' (this will constantly now run and compile on change). */
