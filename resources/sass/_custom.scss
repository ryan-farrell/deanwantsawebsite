// Our custom file to add new scss to our webapp


/* REMEMBER to compile after adding/changing any scss. So I'll need to run one of two commands in the terminal to complete 
any updates on my SCSS files and compile thenm and rendered to our .CSS file in our public folder.

We can use:

'npm run dev' (which will complile and render on each time this runs)

or

'npm run watch' (this will constantly now run and compile on change). */
